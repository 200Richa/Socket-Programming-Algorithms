# Socket-Programming-Algorithms  

This project implements socket programming and will also demonstrate various sorting algorithms.  
In this project the client will send input a list of numbers to the server. The server then responds by sending a sorted list back to the client.
The client will have the option to choose a sorting algorithm from a list of available algorithms. This project will also provide a command line visualization of the various algorithms. The swaps made at every step will be shown so as to provide a basic understanding of the chosen algorithm.
